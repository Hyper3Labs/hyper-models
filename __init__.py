"""hyper-models: geometry-aware embedding model registry.

A timm-like registry for hyperbolic/spherical embedding models with ONNX export.
Designed to work with HyperView but can be used standalone.

This directory is intentionally *not* part of the published HyperView package.
It will evolve into a standalone `hyper-models` PyPI package.
